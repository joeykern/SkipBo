HOW TO PLAY:

Start by entering " make " to compile the files.

Then, run the command:
./skipbo false 4 5 deck0.txt

false means the deck won't be shuffled (true will shuffle the deck).
4 is the number of players.
5 is the size of the players' stock piles. 

The goal of the game is to empty your stock pile (same rules as the official SkipBo game).

To move a card, a player enters:
m 0 a
for example to move the card from the stockpile to the build pile.

Moving a card to the discard pile automatically ends the turn. 

All SkipBo Rules are followed! Have fun.
